Eclyra wouldn't have been possible without the hard work and dedication of its team members:
- **Ayush Ranjan** 
- **Rohit Khallar**
- **Tanisha Rattan**

### **How We Came Up With This Idea**
The team noticed firsthand how individuals and small businesses struggled with selling scrap, especially electronic waste, due to a lack of proper channels and fair pricing. Seeing people discard valuable e-waste improperly, leading to both environmental hazards and financial loss, we decided to create Eclyra‚Äîan AI-powered platform that simplifies scrap selling, ensures transparent pricing, and encourages responsible e-waste disposal. By integrating real-time pricing, chatbot assistance, and community engagement, Eclyra is set to revolutionize the waste management industry.
