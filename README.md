Seeing people discard valuable e-waste improperly, leading to both environmental hazards and financial loss, we decided to create Eclyra‚Äîan AI-powered platform that simplifies scrap selling, ensures transparent pricing, and encourages responsible e-waste disposal. By integrating real-time pricing, chatbot assistance, and community engagement, Eclyra is set to revolutionize the waste management industry.
