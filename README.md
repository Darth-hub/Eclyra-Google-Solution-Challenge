## Overview  

Eclyra is leading the way in creating a sustainable and profitable solution for both individuals and businesses. Our platform bridges the gap between scrap sellers and scrap collectors, ensuring that recyclable materials donâ€™t go to waste but instead contribute to a circular economy.The project utilizes ReactJS for the frontend, Firebase for authentication, real-time updates, and hosting, Tailwind CSS for styling, and firebase-firestore for data storage.In addition, we've also integrated AI/ML into our site, by utilising an Dialogflow CX and Vertex AI allowing users to access the Eclyra eazily.
